****PROJECT NAME:** **ðŸ¦´ X-ray Fracture Detection AI**

A deep learning-powered web app built with TensorFlow and Streamlit to detect bone fractures from X-ray images. Upload an image, and the AI predicts whether the bone is fractured or normal â€” along with confidence visualization.


## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Upload bone X-ray images (JPEG, PNG)
- ðŸ§  Predicts **Fractured** or **Normal** using a trained deep learning model
- ðŸ“Š Confidence score with dynamic progress bar
- ðŸŽ¨ Clean UI with custom CSS for modern aesthetics
- âš¡ Real-time inference in the browser using Streamlit


## ðŸ§  Model Info

The model used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a labeled dataset of bone X-ray images (Fractured / Normal). The input image is resized to **64x64** and normalized before inference.

> **Model File:** `fracture_xray_model.h5`


## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- [TensorFlow/Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/) â€“ For training and loading the model  
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) â€“ To create the interactive UI  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) â€“ Image preprocessing  
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/) â€“ Image handling


## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AkulaArchana04/xray-fracture-detection.git
   cd xray-fracture-detection


**Place the trained model:**
 
 Ensure your fracture_xray_model.h5 file is in the root directory.

**Run the Streamlit app:**

 streamlit run app.py
